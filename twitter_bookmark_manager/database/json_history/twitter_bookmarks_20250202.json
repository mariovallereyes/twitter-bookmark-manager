about?\n\nI’ve recently outlined my thoughts in an episode of SwirlAI Newsletter.\n\nIn my opinion the role best fits generalists that posses a blend of skills from:\n\n➡️ AI Researcher.\n➡️ ML Engineer.\n➡️ Software Engineer.\n➡️ (Potentially) Data Engineer.\n\nUnfortunately, it is naive to expect professionals to have fluency in all of them. My short term prediction is that most of the specialists in the role will have a blend of two, falling into one of the categories 𝟭. to 𝟯.\n\nSurprisingly, there is a lot of non-engineering related work in your day-to-day life as an AI engineer. The organisations are still on a hype train around LLMs, and you would be pushed to implement the technology wherever, even if there is no good fit. One of your key responsibilities will be to coach the organisation and be at the forefront of deciding where and if GenAI is necessary to solve a business problem.\n\nAI Engineer is positioned to be the hottest role in the upcoming years. The salaries are high and the demand will keep increasing due to the shortage of talent in the field. 2025 will be the year of agents, 2026 - very likely the year of multi agent systems and autonomous agents.\n\nYou can find the article here: https://t.co/r8oJDdK9Xj\n\nI put my thoughts on:\n\n➡️ Why the new role is justified. I ground the reasoning in how LLM based apps have evolved in recent years.\n➡️ What it would take to become an AI Engineer.\n➡️ The future of the role.\n\n❗️ Bold prediction: most of the engineers will be developing full stack in ~2 years. Every one of them will need to possess skills of what we call an AI Engineer today.\n\nLet me know your thoughts about the role! 👇\n\n#AI #LLM #MachineLearning","tweeted_at":"2025-01-17T13:31:54.000Z","extended_media":[{"display_url":"pic.x.com/A2vjQixAlt","expanded_url":"https://x.com/Aurimas_Gr/status/1880246673735024886/photo/1","id_str":"1880246636019843072","indices":[263,286],"media_key":"16_1880246636019843072","media_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video_thumb/Ghf6Wn4WAAAtA9U.jpg","type":"animated_gif","url":"https://t.co/A2vjQixAlt","ext_media_availability":{"status":"Available"},"sizes":{"large":{"h":1352,"w":1248,"resize":"fit"},"medium":{"h":1200,"w":1108,"resize":"fit"},"small":{"h":680,"w":628,"resize":"fit"},"thumb":{"h":150,"w":150,"resize":"crop"}},"original_info":{"height":1352,"width":1248,"focus_rects":[]},"allow_download_status":{"allow_download":true},"video_info":{"aspect_ratio":[12,13],"variants":[{"bitrate":0,"content_type":"video/mp4","url":"https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/Ghf6Wn4WAAAtA9U.mp4"}]},"media_results":{"result":{"media_key":"16_1880246636019843072"}}}],"tweet_url":"https://x.com/Aurimas_Gr/status/1880246673735024886"},{"profile_image_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1728327996375719936/RW7VBJfD_normal.jpg","screen_name":"kimmonismus","name":"Chubby♨️","full_text":"Hugging Face is doing a free and certified course on LLM Agents!\n\n- Understanding Agents: We'll break down the fundamentals of AI agents, showing you how they use LLMs to perceive their environment (observations), reason about it (thoughts), and take actions.

Define workflows to retrieve, update, and use memory for informed responses.\n\n7) Incorporate a knowledge graph\nUse Zep's knowledge graph to store and query relationships, and enrich responses.\n\n8) Develop and test contextual prompts\nCreate prompts that dynamically use memory and knowledge graphs for relevant, secure responses.\n\n9) Secure data\nImplement robust security measures and restrict data access.\n\n10) Monitor, improve, and scale\nUse analytics and feedback to refine memory systems and scale capabilities.\n\nThese steps provide a high-level guide for building stateful AI agents.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into how memory works or integrating it, here's a great article: https://t.co/2Gy4AvbnkU\n\n💭 Over to you.

Episodic - This type of memory contains past interactions and actions performed by the agent. After an action is taken, the application controlling the agent would store the action in some kind of persistent storage so that it can be retrieved later if needed. A good example would be using a vector Database to store semantic meaning of the interactions.\n\n𝟮. Semantic - Any external information that is available to the agent and any knowledge the agent should have about itself. You can think of this as a context similar to one used in RAG applications. It can be internal knowledge only available to the agent or a grounding context to isolate part of the internet scale data for more accurate answers.\n\n𝟯. Procedural - This is systemic information like the structure of the System Prompt, available tools, guardrails etc. It will usually be stored in Git, Prompt and Tool Registries.\n\n𝟰. Occasionally, the agent application would pull information from long-term memory and store it locally if it is needed for the task at hand.\n\n𝟱. All of the information pulled together from the long-term or stored in local memory is called short-term or working memory. Compiling all of it into a prompt will produce the prompt to be passed to the LLM and it will provide further actions to be taken by the system.\n\nWe usually label 1. - 3. as Long-Term memory and 5. as Short-Term memory.\n\nA visual explanation of potential implementation details 👇\n\nAnd that is it! The rest is all about how you architect the flow of your Agentic systems. \n\nWhat do you think about memory in AI Agents?\n\n#LLM #AI #MachineLearning\n\nWant to learn how to build an Agent from scratch without any LLM orchestration framework?

Ready to bring high agency systems to life?\nFrom open source AI agent developer tools like AgentOps to Fortune 500 enterprises, we help clients create safe, reliable, and scalable AI agents.","id_str":"1877507581297725440","indices":[84,107],"media_key":"3_1877507581297725440","media_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gg4_Mp5akAAc_QX.jpg","type":"photo","url":"https://t.co/KyaWaZ22u6","ext_media_availability":{"status":"Available"},"features":{"all":{"tags":[{"user_id":"1717013899617468416","name":"AgentOps 🖇️","screen_name":"AgentOpsAI","type":"user"}]},"large":{"faces":[]},"medium":{"faces":[]},"small":{"faces":[]},"orig":{"faces":[]}},"sizes":{"large":{"h":1374,"w":1316,"resize":"fit"},"medium":{"h":1200,"w":1149,"resize":"fit"},"small":{"h":680,"w":651,"resize":"fit"},"thumb":{"h":150,"w":150,"resize":"crop"}},"original_info":{"height":1374,"width":1316,"focus_rects":[{"x":0,"y":637,"w":1316,"h":737},{"x":0,"y":58,"w":1316,"h":1316},{"x":50,"y":0,"w":1205,"h":1374},{"x":309,"y":0,"w":687,"h":1374},{"x":0,"y":0,"w":1316,"h":1374}]},"allow_download_status":{"allow_download":true},"media_results":{"result":{"media_key":"3_1877507581297725440"}}}],"tweet_url":"https://x.com/AtomSilverman/status/1877507585256923450"},{"profile_image_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1782802003078299648/q3bQeEyp_normal.jpg","screen_name":"cj_zZZz","name":"Cj Z 🎯","full_text":"\"AI Agent\" is a BUZZ word right now.\n\nThe tech is not ready yet.\n\nAI agents are not possible without cheap reasoning models.\n\nTruth is, 98% AI agents are built with just IF or ELSE logic with tool calling and RAG capability.\n\nSo they are not AI agents, but coded workers.\n\nHere's https://t.co/7zK9N4v7Jd","note_tweet_text":"\"AI Agent\" is a BUZZ word right now.\n\nThe tech is not ready yet.\n\nAI agents are not possible without cheap reasoning models.\n\nTruth is, 98% AI agents are built with just IF or ELSE logic with tool calling and RAG capability.\n\nSo they are not AI agents, but coded workers.\n\nHere's all you need to know about AI Agents:\n\nI worked with 40+ companies in 2024 and the most in demand product was - AI Agents.\n\nBut then I explained them What is an AI agent exactly.\n\nAn AI agent is a system that can think, reason, plan, execute and evaluate tasks on its own.\n\nThat system won't require human input for each step. It can learn from collected data and its own mistakes over time.\n\nBut is this Agent Tech available right now?\n\nUnfortunately no, it's not production ready.\n\nBecause the main piece of Agent tech is missing - Reasoning LLM models.\n\nModels like GPT-4o, Sonnet 3.5, or open source models like Llama 3 are not Reasoning models, but implementation models.\n\nIf you give them a detailed plan, they can execute perfectly 9/10 times but if you ask them to reason, think, plan and execute they mess up 8/10 times.\n\nOpenAI o1 model showed glimpses of smart reasoning. \n\nBut it's not available to all via API (only tier 5) \n\nand also its not cheap ($15 per million input tokens and $60 per million output tokens)\n\nand lastly, it is slow (It takes 5 minutes on average to reason, think, and plan before executing and task)\n\nSo as of now, we can build an AI agent that can work on its own but the accuracy of those agents are bad. They need human oversight. \n\nBut in future we'll see 2 types of models:\n1. Cheap and fast reasoning models\n2. Ultra cheap and super fast implementation models\n\nAnd AI agents will use a mixture of these agents for specific tasks. \n\nHow far is this AI Agent Tech? I think atleast 6 months from now. \n\nAI agents also need better framework (large context window, better system than RAG and large number of tools in their armoury)\n\no3 model may solve reasoning issue and we also see some great open source reasoning models.\n\nAgentic system is the biggest vertical opportunity in AI Tech. \n\nAgents will learn, adapt and refine their logic on their own, and over time they'll become the best in their domain because of the collected structured data, and refined workflow. (but that will happen in future)\n\nBottom line: AI Agent OS (operating system) is not ready yet. It requires cheap, fast and better reasoning models, large context window, and better system than RAG. \n\nIt'll take some time to get there. But you can stll build:\n- voice to voice agents\n- research agents\n- systematic agents\n\nBuild them for different b2b industries and sell them as a service or as a software.\n\nCompanies are pouring money into AI innovation to get ahead of their competitors. They need AI Growth Consultants and AI Tech Devs to help them build their internal AI stack.\n\nBuild these systems for them and learn about alot of different industries. \n\nI predict that AI SaaS founders will build the best AI agents! If you're not playing with AI code yet, you're losing the game. \n\nThat's why I'm building @CodeGuidedev . It's turning out to be the home of AI coders.\n\nWe're just 17-days old startup with 956 AI coders building projects with AI.\n\nCodeGuide 2.0 is 98% ready.

the key-value (KV) cache.\n\nThe preloaded context helps the model to provide contextually accurate answers without the need for additional retrieval during runtime.\n\nWhen to apply CAG?\n\nIt's a useful alternative to RAG for cases where the documents/knowledge for retrieval are of limited, manageable size.\n\nMy thoughts: As LLMs advance in capabilities, I suspect that what we know as RAG today could change significantly either architecturally or how it's optimized. CAG is one in a growing list of developments and new ideas that have emerged recently to address limitations like poor retrieval relevancy and latency. There could also be hybrid methods that combine preloading with selective retrieval.\n\nDon't sleep on long-context LLMs. They are here to stay.","tweeted_at":"2025-01-07T20:03:01.000Z","extended_media":[{"display_url":"pic.x.com/I30uNLaziN","expanded_url":"https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1876721221083214200/photo/1","id_str":"1876721218352799744","indices":[279,302],"media_key":"3_1876721218352799744","media_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ggt0ATpbYAAOr4N.png","type":"photo","url":"https://t.co/I30uNLaziN","ext_media_availability":{"status":"Available"},"features":{"large":{"faces":[{"x":532,"y":442,"h":171,"w":171}]},"medium":{"faces":[{"x":532,"y":442,"h":171,"w":171}]},"small":{"faces":[{"x":391,"y":325,"h":125,"w":125}]},"orig":{"faces":[{"x":532,"y":442,"h":171,"w":171}]}},"sizes":{"large":{"h":751,"w":923,"resize":"fit"},"medium":{"h":751,"w":923,"resize":"fit"},"small":{"h":553,"w":680,"resize":"fit"},"thumb":{"h":150,"w":150,"resize":"crop"}},"original_info":{"height":751,"width":923,"focus_rects":[{"x":0,"y":0,"w":923,"h":517},{"x":109,"y":0,"w":751,"h":751},{"x":155,"y":0,"w":659,"h":751},{"x":296,"y":0,"w":376,"h":751},{"x":0,"y":0,"w":923,"h":751}]},"media_results":{"result":{"media_key":"3_1876721218352799744"}}}],"tweet_url":"https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1876721221083214200"},{"profile_image_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1725897062296772608/pkRjNV01_normal.jpg","screen_name":"Aurimas_Gr","name":"Aurimas Griciūnas","full_text":"Here is why you need to understand 𝗔𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗥𝗔𝗚 as an AI Engineer.\n\nSimple naive RAG systems are rarely used in real world applications.

To provide correct actions to solve the user intent, we are always adding some agency to the RAG system - it is usually just a bit of it.\n\nIt is important to 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝗹𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝘂𝘇𝘇 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝘆 and understand that there is 𝗻𝗼 𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗯𝗹𝘂𝗲𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝘁 to add this agency to your RAG system and you should adapt to your use case. My advice is to think in systems and engineering flows.\n\nLet’s explore some of the moving pieces in Agentic RAG:\n\n𝟭. Analysis of the user query: we pass the original user query to a LLM based Agent for analysis. This is where:\n\n➡️ The original query can be rewritten, sometimes multiple times to create either a single or multiple queries to be passed down the pipeline.\n➡️ The agent decides if additional data sources are required to answer the query.\n\n𝟮. If additional data is required, the Retrieval step is triggered. In Agentic RAG case, we could have a single or multiple agents responsible for figuring out what data sources should be tapped into, few examples:\n\n➡️ Real time user data. This is a pretty cool concept as we might have some real time information like current location available for the user.\n➡️ Internal documents that a user might be interested in.\n➡️ Data available on the web.\n➡️ …\n\n𝟯. If there is no need for additional data, we try to compose the answer (or multiple answers or a set of actions) straight via an LLM.\n𝟰. The answer gets analyzed, summarized and evaluated for correctness and relevance:\n\n➡️ If the Agent decides that the answer is good enough, it gets returned to the user.\n➡️ If the Agent decides that the answer needs improvement, we try to rewrite the user query and repeat the generation loop.\n\n✅ Remember the Reflection pattern from my last Newsletter article? This is exactly that. 👆\n\nThe real power of Agentic RAG lies in its ability to perform additional routing pre and post generation, handle multiple distinct data sources for retrieval if it is needed and recover from failures while generating correct answers.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Agentic RAG?

You're LUCKY to hit 15% margins after paying employees, rent etc. \n\nMost agency founders spend their Sundays dreading Monday's personnel issues.\n\nbut I'm watching something fascinating emerge in 2025 and i wanted to share it with you. \n\nAI agents aren't perfect yet. but the writing is on the wall: what currently takes 50 people will soon be done by 2 people orchestrating 50 AI workers. \n\nsame revenue, but margins jump from 20% to 80%. no overhead, no drama, pure profit. clients pay less, get faster work.\n\non the outside, nothing will change. same agency, same deliverables. but on the inside,  pure sweet software margins. yum.\n\ni wouldnt be surprised if suddenly silicon valley liked the agency business. just a way to learn a workflow, automate, build a cash-machine and invest that into tech that makes the whole machine work smoother.\n\nme and my holdco (we've got a few agencies) will invest millions of dollars into this. putting our money where our mouth

agent\n\nThe hedge fund is powered by @LangChainAI \n\nYou can run all of my code below.\n\nNo prior coding experience is required.\n\nAll of the agents show their reasoning so you can see how they work.\n\n1 • Market Data Agent: gathers market data like stock prices, fundamentals, etc.\n\n2 • Quant Agent: calculates signals like MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, etc.\n\n3 • Fundamentals Agent: analyzes profitability, growth, financial health, and valuation.\n\n4 • Sentiment Agent: looks at insider trades to determine insider sentiment.\n\n5 • Risk Manager: determines risk metrics like volatility, drawdown, and more.\n\n6 • Portfolio Manager: makes final trading decisions and generates orders.\n\nThis is just the start.\n\nThere are a ton of cool features that we can add.\n\nLet me know if you have any suggestions.","tweeted_at":"2024-12-21T16:54:20.000Z","extended_media":[{"display_url":"pic.x.com/NXucNQnzIr","expanded_url":"https://x.com/virattt/status/1870513142981353703/photo/1","id_str":"1870512884389920768","indices":[273,296],"media_key":"3_1870512884389920768","media_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GfVljtXaQAALP1q.jpg","type":"photo","url":"https://t.co/NXucNQnzIr","ext_media_availability":{"status":"Available"},"features":{"large":{"faces":[]},"medium":{"faces":[]},"small":{"faces":[]},"orig":{"faces":[]}},"sizes":{"large":{"h":700,"w":2040,"resize":"fit"},"medium":{"h":412,"w":1200,"resize":"fit"},"small":{"h":233,"w":680,"resize":"fit"},"thumb":{"h":150,"w":150,"resize":"crop"}},"original_info":{"height":700,"width":2040,"focus_rects":[{"x":0,"y":0,"w":1250,"h":700},{"x":210,"y":0,"w":700,"h":700},{"x":253,"y":0,"w":614,"h":700},{"x":385,"y":0,"w":350,"h":700},{"x":0,"y":0,"w":2040,"h":700}]},"media_results":{"result":{"media_key":"3_1870512884389920768"}}}],"tweet_url":"https://x.com/virattt/status/1870513142981353703"},{"profile_image_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1245832762315194373/cjhzVk4V_normal.jpg","screen_name":"ScholarshipfPhd","name":"Scholarship

zero in only on cancer cells. \n\nExperiments  in mice showed the strategy is effective at shrinking brain and breast  cancer tumors.\n\nThe research team overcame a significant challenge to break up structures inside these cellular energy centers, called mitochondria, with a technique that induces light-activated electrical currents inside the cell. They named the technology mLumiOpto. \n\nMitochondria, the primary producers of energy that fuels cell functions, have been considered an attractive anti cancer therapeutic target for years, but their impermeable inner membrane complicates these efforts. Zhou’s lab cracked the code five years ago by figuring out how to exploit the inner membrane’s vulnerability – an electrical charge differential that keeps its structure intact and functions on track. \n\n“Previous attempts to use a pharmaceutical reagent against mitochondria targeted specific pathways of activity in cancer cells,” he said. “Our approach targets mitochondria directly, using external genes to activate a process that kills cells. That’s an advantage, and we’ve shown we can get a very good result in killing different types of cancer cells.”","tweeted_at":"2024-12-13T23:21:29.000Z","extended_media":[{"display_url":"pic.x.com/61SwEARBib","expanded_url":"https://x.com/Dr_Singularity/status/1867711469741126016/photo/1","id_str":"1867709806988967936","indices":[280,303],"media_key":"3_1867709806988967936","media_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GetwLIUXQAAter0.jpg","type":"photo","url":"https://t.co/61SwEARBib","ext_media_availability":{"status":"Available"},"features":{"large":{"faces":[]},"medium":{"faces":[]},"small":{"faces":[]},"orig":{"faces":[]}},"sizes":{"large":{"h":858,"w":849,"resize":"fit"},"medium":{"h":858,"w":849,"resize":"fit"},"small":{"h":680,"w":673,"resize":"fit"},"thumb":{"h":150,"w":150,"resize":"crop"}},"original_info":{"height":858,"width":849,"focus_rects":[{"x":0,"y":383,"w":849,"h":475},{"x":0,"y":9,"w":849,"h":849},{"x":0,"y":0,"w":753,"h":858},{"x":0,"y":0,"w":429,"h":858},{"x":0,"y":0,"w":849,"h":858}]},"allow_download_status":{"allow_download":true},"media_results":{"result":{"media_key":"3_1867709806988967936"}}}],"tweet_url":"https://x.com/Dr_Singularity/status/1867711469741126016"},{"profile_image_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1683527188782432269/rne8h7-S_normal.jpg","screen_name":"quantscience_","name":"Quant Science","full_text":"Things you don't need to be successful at algorithmic trading:\n\n1.
