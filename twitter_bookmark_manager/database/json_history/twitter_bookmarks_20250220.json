Episodic - This type of memory contains past interactions and actions performed by the agent. After an action is taken, the application controlling the agent would store the action in some kind of persistent storage so that it can be retrieved later if needed. A good example would be using a vector Database to store semantic meaning of the interactions.\n\n𝟮. Semantic - Any external information that is available to the agent and any knowledge the agent should have about itself. You can think of this as a context similar to one used in RAG applications. It can be internal knowledge only available to the agent or a grounding context to isolate part of the internet scale data for more accurate answers.\n\n𝟯. Procedural - This is systemic information like the structure of the System Prompt, available tools, guardrails etc. It will usually be stored in Git, Prompt and Tool Registries.\n\n𝟰. Occasionally, the agent application would pull information from long-term memory and store it locally if it is needed for the task at hand.\n\n𝟱. All of the information pulled together from the long-term or stored in local memory is called short-term or working memory. Compiling all of it into a prompt will produce the prompt to be passed to the LLM and it will provide further actions to be taken by the system.\n\nWe usually label 1. - 3. as Long-Term memory and 5. as Short-Term memory.\n\nA visual explanation of potential implementation details 👇\n\nAnd that is it! The rest is all about how you architect the topology of your Agentic Systems. \n\nWhat do you think about memory in AI Agents?\n\n#LLM #AI

But in a team, you can't expect that everyone follows your vision and long term goals.\n\nRecently I found myself questioning the entire planning routine. Even though I already use AI to generate specs, it still takes effort to prepare them for sprints, organizing them into tickets e.g.\n\nAnd then we have this situation where the PM is generating the specs and user stories with AI. And the devs are generating a summary of the Stories and the Code with AI. You get it.\n\nCode Sommelier:\n- Act as Product Manager + Software Architect + \"Foreman\" Dev\n- Mainly uses Deep Research + Pro Models to generate \"Codestories\"\n- Leads the Team and give direction\n\nDev:\n- Picking a CodeStory from the Roadmap\n- Puts the building blocks together with AI\n- Does Quality Checks and Tests\n\nThe Concept:\nThe main idea is to generate code snippets that fit seamlessly into the overall architecture, since the LLM has a full understanding of it.\n\nAdditionally, through the research process, you’ve already identified and preselected a suitable tech stack.\n\nJust like a sommelier selecting the perfect wine for each course.\n\nExample:\nDefining an ERD Diagram is unnecessary when devs can get the full Drizzle schema in one run. If someone needs an explanation then reverse it to a diagram.\n\n- Traditional Development: Thorough and methodical, but can drown you in specs, user stories, and sprint rituals. Good for clarity, slower to deliver.\n\n- Vibe Coding: Fast and freeform. Let the AI build everything on the fly, but structure and consistency often suffer. Fine for tiny side projects, risky for bigger team efforts.\n\n- Sommelier Coding: Balances speed and oversight. Think of it like a sommelier selecting the perfect wine for each course - curating the best fit while giving everyone a taste of the outcome.

While effective, traditional RAG systems are static and limited to predefined workflows.\n\n》 Evolution of RAG Systems\n\n✸ Naïve RAG: Relies on keyword-based retrieval, leading to fragmented outputs and scalability issues.\n\n✸ Advanced RAG: Incorporates semantic retrieval techniques like Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) and neural re-ranking for improved precision.\n\n✸ Modular RAG: Introduces hybrid retrieval strategies, APIs, and composable pipelines for task-specific optimization.\n\n✸ Graph RAG: Enhances multi-hop reasoning using graph-based structures but suffers from scalability challenges.\n\n✸ Agentic RAG: Surpasses these by introducing autonomous decision-making, iterative refinement, and real-time workflow optimization.\n\n》 What is Agentic RAG?\n\n✸ Agentic RAG builds on this by embedding autonomous agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents dynamically refine context, optimize retrieval strategies, and adapt in real time to the complexity of queries, making them ideal for sophisticated, multi-step tasks.\n\n》 Core Agentic Patterns\n\n✸ Reflection: Enables agents to critique and refine outputs iteratively, boosting accuracy.\n\n✸ Planning: Decomposes complex tasks into manageable subtasks, ensuring flexibility in execution.\n\n✸ Tool Use: Integrates external resources, like APIs or databases, to enhance generative outputs.\n\n✸ Multi-Agent Collaboration: Specialized agents collaborate to handle complex workflows efficiently.\n\n》 Benefits of Agentic RAG\n\n✸ Dynamic Adaptability: Adjusts workflows in real time based on task requirements.\n\n✸ Enhanced Contextual Understanding: Iteratively refines outputs for higher relevance and accuracy.\n\n✸ Scalability and Flexibility: Handles multi-domain queries with seamless integration of tools and data.\n\n✸ Workflow Optimization: Reduces latency, ensuring efficiency even in high-demand scenarios.\n\n》 --New-- Agentic Workflow Patterns\n\n✸ Prompt Chaining: Breaks tasks into multiple steps\n\n✸ Routing: Directs queries to specialized processes\n\n✸ Parallelization: Runs processes simultaneously\n\n✸ Orchestrator-Worker Model: Assigns subtasks to agents\n\n✸ Evaluator-Optimizer Loop: Iteratively refines responses\n\npaper: https://t.co/vyZhZTjPQG\nGithub: https://t.co/LBuWmL6iWV\n\n≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣≣\n\nBuild systems like the above paper?\n\n🔮 Join My 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐬-𝐎𝐧 𝐀𝐈 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 TODAY!\n➠ Langgraph/Langchain, CrewAI, OpenAI Swarm\n➠ Vision Models + RAG + Tabular Data + Video + Audio\n\n𝐄𝐧𝐫𝐨𝐥𝐥 𝐍𝐎𝐖 [34% discount -

Lifting heavy 2–3 times per week is essential for maintaining and building muscle while losing fat. Without it, muscle mass inevitably declines. \n\nNutrition also plays a major role. Eating in a slight calorie deficit—around 10–20% below maintenance—allows for steady fat loss without sacrificing muscle, energy levels, or training performance.\n\nProtein intake is another key priority. Research shows that consuming 1.8 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day is optimal for muscle retention and growth during a calorie deficit, and going even higher may provide additional benefits.\n\nBeyond training and nutrition, recovery is just as crucial. Adequate sleep, stress management, and tracking progress help ensure you’re making real, sustainable changes. Get this right and you have a powerful strategy to build muscle and lose fat.\n\nIf you want to learn more about optimizing body recomposition, improving VO2 max, and enhancing brain health, tune into

There are numerous evidence-based ways that actually work! But… most of what you've heard is wrong. So, let’s clear up the confusion on what’s bogus, what’s real, and what ‘speeding up your metabolism’ really means - and what it does not!\n\nA deep dive into the research with surprising findings:\n\nFirst: You can't actually \"speed up\" your metabolism. That's like saying you can make your car drive faster when it's parked.\n\nWhat you can do is influence how many \"miles\" your metabolism drives each day.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nYour Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) has 4 components:\n\n1. Exercise Activity (EAT): 0-30% of calories\n2. Non-Exercise Activity (NEAT): 5-30%\n3. Thermal Effect of Food (TEF): 8-15%\n4. Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR): 40-80%\n\nThe research shows there are both acute (temporary; minutes to hours) and chronic (long-term; days to weeks or months) ways to influence these components. Most of the nonsense in this topic comes from people making claims about things that enhance ‘metabolic rate’ acutely - which as you’ll see, is actually quite easy to do. But this is very deceiving because acute increase often means very little in the long-term, especially for outcomes like fat loss, and they aren’t necessarily increasing your metabolism in the way you think (they ramp up RMR, for a few minutes, but then it goes right back down to normal, or even below baseline). So, it’s quite easy to deceive with legitimate science here.\n\nThat said, let's look at what actually works for acute changes, and by how much:\n\nAcute Boosters:\n\n1. Spicy foods (peppers, ginger, chilis, etc.)\n\n- Increases RMR by 3-5%\n- Effect lasts 1-2 hours\n- Often through capsaicin in chili peppers\n\n2. Cold exposure\n\n- Lowering room temp by few degrees\n- Can lead to significant fat loss over time\n\n3. Caffeine\n\n- Increases RMR by 3-11%\n- Lasts 1-3 hours\n- Also reduces appetite\n\n4. Green tea\n\n- 4-5% RMR increase\n- Similar duration to caffeine\n- Compounds with caffeine for better results\n\nBut here's what's really interesting: The chronic (long-term) changes are what really matter for sustainable results.\n\nResearch shows 4 key factors for long-term metabolic enhancement:\n\n1. Quality Sleep\n\n- Poor sleep reduces RMR\n- Increases hunger hormones\n- Can reduce fat loss by 55%\n- Affects muscle preservation\n\n2. Fish Oil (3g/day)\n\n- 14% increase in RMR\n- 19% increase in fat oxidation\n- 4% increase in lean mass over 12 weeks\n\n3. Muscle Mass\n\n- Each pound burns 6-10 extra calories daily\n- Primary factor in age-related metabolic decline\n- Explains up to 80% of RMR variance\n\n4. Exercise\n\n- Strength training: +100 cal/day RMR\n- Cardio: +50-60 cal/day RMR\n- Combined: +75 cal/day RMR\n\nThe most effective approach? Combining multiple strategies:\n\n- 200 cal from additional exercise\n- Fish oil + green tea (+25-50 cal)\n- Protein increase (+45 cal from TEF)\n- 15-min daily walk (+100 cal)\n- Small calorie reduction (-80 cal)\n\nThis approach works because it:\n\n- Doesn't crash your metabolism\n- Preserves muscle mass\n- Avoids adaptive thermogenesis\n- Creates sustainable habits\n\nThe key isn't finding one magic solution - it's stacking small, evidence-based changes.\n\nRemember: Your metabolism isn't \"fast\" or \"slow.\"\n\nIt's responding to your daily choices in sleep, nutrition, activity, and muscle mass.\n\nFocus on these factors consistently, and you'll create lasting metabolic health.","tweeted_at":"2025-02-06T19:08:12.000Z","tweet_url":"https://x.com/DrAndyGalpin/status/1887579059808575764"},{"profile_image_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1648855796179156992/zLtBu1wG_normal.jpg","screen_name":"dshukertjr","name":"Tyler Shukert","full_text":"We have created a list of Cursor rules you can copy and paste into your codebase! \n\nEach rule comes with a sample description and glob pattern so that your rule is only applied to the appropriate use case. \n\nWhat other sample rules should we create on top of what we have now? https://t.co/M0wc2Y6cz7","tweeted_at":"2025-02-06T13:02:00.000Z","extended_media":[{"display_url":"pic.x.com/M0wc2Y6cz7","expanded_url":"https://x.com/dshukertjr/status/1887486904469262837/video/1","id_str":"1887352316623491072","indices":[277,300],"media_key":"7_1887352316623491072","media_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1887352316623491072/pu/img/7D33dKMYxpCzfWoy.jpg","type":"video","url":"https://t.co/M0wc2Y6cz7","additional_media_info":{"monetizable":false},"ext_media_availability":{"status":"Available"},"sizes":{"large":{"h":1280,"w":2048,"resize":"fit"},"medium":{"h":750,"w":1200,"resize":"fit"},"small":{"h":425,"w":680,"resize":"fit"},"thumb":{"h":150,"w":150,"resize":"crop"}},"original_info":{"height":1350,"width":2160,"focus_rects":[]},"allow_download_status":{"allow_download":true},"video_info":{"aspect_ratio":[8,5],"duration_millis":23356,"variants":[{"content_type":"application/x-mpegURL","url":"https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1887352316623491072/pu/pl/EwYwx6yznXObqfg8.m3u8?tag=12&v=cfc"},{"bitrate":256000,"content_type":"video/mp4","url":"https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1887352316623491072/pu/vid/avc1/432x270/SZyTPqVKsX3BeYkJ.mp4?tag=12"},{"bitrate":832000,"content_type":"video/mp4","url":"https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1887352316623491072/pu/vid/avc1/576x360/Vpe84YiHL-WN4RJU.mp4?tag=12"},{"bitrate":2176000,"content_type":"video/mp4","url":"https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1887352316623491072/pu/vid/avc1/1152x720/mW9Y31K9EeCEJ6Xk.mp4?tag=12"}]},"media_results":{"result":{"media_key":"7_1887352316623491072"}}}],"tweet_url":"https://x.com/dshukertjr/status/1887486904469262837"},{"profile_image_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1237964548704841736/iai1MNLE_normal.jpg","screen_name":"virattt","name":"virat","full_text":"Our AI hedge fund can now short stocks.\n\nPreviously, it could only go long.\n\nIt can now take 5 actions:\n1 • buy\n2 • sell\n3 • short\n4 • cover\n5 • hold\n\nThis lets the hedge fund go long when it is bullish and short when it is bearish.\n\nThe agents in the hedge fund create https://t.co/NMlDuj1rMp","note_tweet_text":"Our AI hedge fund can now short stocks.\n\nPreviously, it could only go long.\n\nIt can now take 5 actions:\n1 • buy\n2 • sell\n3 • short\n4 • cover\n5 • hold\n\nThis lets the hedge fund go long when it is bullish and short when it is bearish.\n\nThe agents in the hedge fund create bullish / bearish / neutral signals.\n\nThese signals are then given to the portfolio manager.\n\nIt is up to the portfolio manager to decide whether to go long / short / hold.\n\nAn overview of the 5 actions:\n\n1.

Simply clone your repo from Github, open it in @cursor_ai,  share your issue with Deepseek r1 or o1 and ask it to come up with a step-by-step solution\n\n5) If the solution works, either update your code on your main Github manually or simply share the step-by-step solution inside Lovable\n\nImportant nuance: I'm not trying to build a Notion + Miro + Obsidian Frankenstein monster, but rather a knowledge management & learning tool that combines the features that I need.\n\nCurrently trying to convert all my notes, chat logs and resources into embeddings so the LLMs can \"learn\" from them and give me new insights.\n\nI would LOVE to have a ChatGPT Tasks like feature that gives me regular insights \"Hey, I noticed you've been reading a lot about SAEs, maybe this insight might interest you?\" (I'd like the orb in the top left corner to glow when it has found a new insight)\n\nIn fact, I built this tool because I'm currently deep-diving into the intersection of AI & Design, and existing tools weren't doing exactly what I wanted.\n\nWith Lovable I can add new features in real-time.\n\nAnd not just the basic features like a login page or a chatbot, but also the more profound stuff. \n\nI'm literally obsessed with the work and writings of people like @JungleSilicon, @Wattenberger, @thesephist , ... and what's crazy is that I can immediately experiment with and integrate their mind-blowing insights into my own work\n\nEven though most these advanced features fail most of the time, each experiment and philosophical discussion with o1, Claude, or R1 deepens my understanding and expands my intuition about AI & Design.","tweeted_at":"2025-02-03T07:28:58.000Z","extended_media":[{"display_url":"pic.x.com/9dcFgvMSqc","expanded_url":"https://x.com/voidwalker_com/status/1886315930117959699/video/1","id_str":"1886309706055983104","indices":[284,307],"media_key":"7_1886309706055983104","media_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1886309706055983104/pu/img/USirz6eHuYDgj_5b.jpg","type":"video","url":"https://t.co/9dcFgvMSqc","additional_media_info":{"monetizable":false},"ext_media_availability":{"status":"Available"},"sizes":{"large":{"h":1298,"w":2048,"resize":"fit"},"medium":{"h":760,"w":1200,"resize":"fit"},"small":{"h":431,"w":680,"resize":"fit"},"thumb":{"h":150,"w":150,"resize":"crop"}},"original_info":{"height":1318,"width":2080,"focus_rects":[]},"allow_download_status":{"allow_download":true},"video_info":{"aspect_ratio":[1040,659],"duration_millis":47189,"variants":[{"content_type":"application/x-mpegURL","url":"https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1886309706055983104/pu/pl/QH5gWULJ3Pr7r3Qd.m3u8?tag=12&v=cfc"},{"bitrate":256000,"content_type":"video/mp4","url":"https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1886309706055983104/pu/vid/avc1/426x270/A2H-MHKdfwyyWAkt.mp4?tag=12"},{"bitrate":832000,"content_type":"video/mp4","url":"https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1886309706055983104/pu/vid/avc1/568x360/-Aflz8l1NGHeWxNI.mp4?tag=12"},{"bitrate":2176000,"content_type":"video/mp4","url":"https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1886309706055983104/pu/vid/avc1/1136x720/UHelZsFSWbMuXslU.mp4?tag=12"}]},"media_results":{"result":{"media_key":"7_1886309706055983104"}}}],"tweet_url":"https://x.com/voidwalker_com/status/1886315930117959699"},{"profile_image_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1638359113221517312/CBZaJFyA_normal.jpg","screen_name":"minchoi","name":"Min
