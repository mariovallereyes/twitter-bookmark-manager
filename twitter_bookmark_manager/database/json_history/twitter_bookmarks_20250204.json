knowledge management & learning tool that combines the features that I need.\n\nCurrently trying to convert all my notes, chat logs and resources into embeddings so the LLMs can \"learn\" from them and give me new insights.\n\nI would LOVE to have a ChatGPT Tasks like feature that gives me regular insights \"Hey, I noticed you've been reading a lot about SAEs, maybe this insight might interest you?\" (I'd like the orb in the top left corner to glow when it has found a new insight)\n\nIn fact, I built this tool because I'm currently deep-diving into the intersection of AI & Design, and existing tools weren't doing exactly what I wanted.\n\nWith Lovable I can add new features in real-time.\n\nAnd not just the basic features like a login page or a chatbot, but also the more profound stuff. \n\nI'm literally obsessed with the work and writings of people like @JungleSilicon, @Wattenberger, @thesephist , ... and what's crazy is that I can immediately experiment with and integrate their mind-blowing insights into my own work\n\nEven though most these advanced features fail most of the time, each experiment and philosophical discussion with o1, Claude, or R1 deepens my

(Potentially) Data Engineer.\n\nUnfortunately, it is naive to expect professionals to have fluency in all of them. My short term prediction is that most of the specialists in the role will have a blend of two, falling into one of the categories ùü≠. to ùüØ.\n\nSurprisingly, there is a lot of non-engineering related work in your day-to-day life as an AI engineer. The organisations are still on a hype train around LLMs, and you would be pushed to implement the technology wherever, even if there is no good fit. One of your key responsibilities will be to coach the organisation and be at the forefront of deciding where and if GenAI is necessary to solve a business problem.\n\nAI Engineer is positioned to be the hottest role in the upcoming years. The salaries are high and the demand will keep increasing due to the shortage of talent in the field. 2025 will be the year of agents, 2026 - very likely the year of multi agent systems and autonomous agents.\n\nYou can find the article here: https://t.co/r8oJDdK9Xj\n\nI put my thoughts on:\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Why the new role is justified. I ground the reasoning in how LLM based apps have evolved in recent years.\n‚û°Ô∏è What it would take to become an AI Engineer.\n‚û°Ô∏è The future of the role.\n\n‚ùóÔ∏è Bold prediction: most of the engineers will be developing full stack in ~2 years. Every one of them will need to possess skills of what we call an AI Engineer today.\n\nLet me know your thoughts about the role! üëá\n\n#AI #LLM #MachineLearning","tweeted_at":"2025-01-17T13:31:54.000Z","extended_media":[{"display_url":"pic.x.com/A2vjQixAlt","expanded_url":"https://x.com/Aurimas_Gr/status/1880246673735024886/photo/1","id_str":"1880246636019843072","indices":[263,286],"media_key":"16_1880246636019843072","media_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video_thumb/Ghf6Wn4WAAAtA9U.jpg","type":"animated_gif","url":"https://t.co/A2vjQixAlt","ext_media_availability":{"status":"Available"},"sizes":{"large":{"h":1352,"w":1248,"resize":"fit"},"medium":{"h":1200,"w":1108,"resize":"fit"},"small":{"h":680,"w":628,"resize":"fit"},"thumb":{"h":150,"w":150,"resize":"crop"}},"original_info":{"height":1352,"width":1248,"focus_rects":[]},"allow_download_status":{"allow_download":true},"video_info":{"aspect_ratio":[12,13],"variants":[{"bitrate":0,"content_type":"video/mp4","url":"https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/Ghf6Wn4WAAAtA9U.mp4"}]},"media_results":{"result":{"media_key":"16_1880246636019843072"}}}],"tweet_url":"https://x.com/Aurimas_Gr/status/1880246673735024886"},{"profile_image_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1728327996375719936/RW7VBJfD_normal.jpg","screen_name":"kimmonismus","name":"Chubby‚ô®Ô∏è","full_text":"Hugging Face is doing a free and certified course on LLM Agents!\n\n- Understanding Agents: We'll break down the fundamentals of AI agents, showing you how they use LLMs to perceive their environment (observations), reason about it (thoughts), and take actions.

Episodic - This type of memory contains past interactions and actions performed by the agent. After an action is taken, the application controlling the agent would store the action in some kind of persistent storage so that it can be retrieved later if needed. A good example would be using a vector Database to store semantic meaning of the interactions.\n\nùüÆ. Semantic - Any external information that is available to the agent and any knowledge the agent should have about itself. You can think of this as a context similar to one used in RAG applications. It can be internal knowledge only available to the agent or a grounding context to isolate part of the internet scale data for more accurate answers.\n\nùüØ. Procedural - This is systemic information like the structure of the System Prompt, available tools, guardrails etc. It will usually be stored in Git, Prompt and Tool Registries.\n\nùü∞. Occasionally, the agent application would pull information from long-term memory and store it locally if it is needed for the task at hand.\n\nùü±. All of the information pulled together from the long-term or stored in local memory is called short-term or working memory.

It can learn from collected data and its own mistakes over time.\n\nBut is this Agent Tech available right now?\n\nUnfortunately no, it's not production ready.\n\nBecause the main piece of Agent tech is missing - Reasoning LLM models.\n\nModels like GPT-4o, Sonnet 3.5, or open source models like Llama 3 are not Reasoning models, but implementation models.\n\nIf you give them a detailed plan, they can execute perfectly 9/10 times but if you ask them to reason, think, plan and execute they mess up 8/10 times.\n\nOpenAI o1 model showed glimpses of smart reasoning. \n\nBut it's not available to all via API (only tier 5) \n\nand also its not cheap ($15 per million input tokens and $60 per million output tokens)\n\nand lastly, it is slow (It takes 5 minutes on average to reason, think, and plan before executing and task)\n\nSo as of now, we can build an AI agent that can work on its own but the accuracy of those agents are bad. They need human oversight. \n\nBut in future we'll see 2 types of models:\n1. Cheap and fast reasoning models\n2. Ultra cheap and super fast implementation models\n\nAnd AI agents will use a mixture of these agents for specific tasks. \n\nHow far is this AI Agent Tech? I think atleast 6 months from now. \n\nAI agents also need better framework (large context window, better system than RAG and large number of tools in their armoury)\n\no3 model may solve reasoning issue and we also see some great open source reasoning models.\n\nAgentic system is the biggest vertical opportunity in AI Tech. \n\nAgents will learn, adapt and refine their logic on their own, and over time they'll become the best in their domain because of the collected structured data, and refined workflow. (but that will happen in future)\n\nBottom line: AI Agent OS (operating system) is not ready yet. It requires cheap, fast and better reasoning models, large context window, and better system than RAG. \n\nIt'll take some time to get there. But you can stll build:\n- voice to voice agents\n- research agents\n- systematic agents\n\nBuild them for different b2b industries and sell them as a service or as a software.\n\nCompanies are pouring money into AI innovation to get ahead of their competitors. They need AI Growth Consultants and AI Tech Devs to help them build their internal AI stack.\n\nBuild these systems for them and learn about alot of different industries. \n\nI predict that AI SaaS founders will build the best AI agents! If you're not playing with AI code yet, you're losing the game. \n\nThat's why I'm building @CodeGuidedev .

My advice is to think in systems and engineering flows.\n\nLet‚Äôs explore some of the moving pieces in Agentic RAG:\n\nùü≠. Analysis of the user query: we pass the original user query to a LLM based Agent for analysis. This is where:\n\n‚û°Ô∏è The original query can be rewritten, sometimes multiple times to create either a single or multiple queries to be passed down the pipeline.\n‚û°Ô∏è The agent decides if additional data sources are required to answer the query.\n\nùüÆ. If additional data is required, the Retrieval step is triggered. In Agentic RAG case, we could have a single or multiple agents responsible for figuring out what data sources should be tapped into, few examples:\n\n‚û°Ô∏è Real time user data. This is a pretty cool concept as we might have some real time information like current location available for the user.\n‚û°Ô∏è Internal documents that a user might be interested in.\n‚û°Ô∏è Data available on the web.\n‚û°Ô∏è ‚Ä¶\n\nùüØ. If there is no need for additional data, we try to compose the answer (or multiple answers or a set of actions) straight via an LLM.\nùü∞. The answer gets analyzed, summarized and evaluated for correctness and relevance:\n\n‚û°Ô∏è If the Agent decides that the answer is good enough, it gets returned to the user.\n‚û°Ô∏è If the Agent decides that the answer needs improvement, we try to rewrite the user query and repeat the generation loop.\n\n‚úÖ Remember the Reflection pattern from my last Newsletter article? This is exactly that. üëÜ\n\nThe real power of Agentic RAG lies in its ability to perform additional routing pre and post generation, handle multiple distinct data sources for retrieval if it is needed and recover from failures while generating correct answers.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Agentic RAG?

Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep.\n2. Understand ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.\n3. Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.\n4. You must own equity‚Äîa piece of a business‚Äîto gain your financial freedom.\n5. You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.\n6. Pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people.\n7. The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers.\n8. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.\n9. Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.\n10. Don‚Äôt partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.\n11. Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.\n12. Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.\n13. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you.\n14. Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.\n15. Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.\n16. When specific knowledge is taught, it‚Äôs through apprenticeships, not schools.\n17. Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.\n18. Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name.\n19. Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.\n20. Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication.\n21. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge with accountability and show resulting good judgment.\n22. Labor means people working for you. It‚Äôs the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage.\n23. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don‚Äôt waste your life chasing it.\n24. Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you.\n25. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.\n26. Code and media are permissionless leverage. They‚Äôre the leverage behind the newly rich.\n27. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.\n28. An army of robots is freely available‚Äîit‚Äôs just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency.

myself often thinking back to or referring to, in ~random order:\n\nAll short stories by Ted Chiang, especially Exhalation, Division By Zero, Understand, The Story of Your Life, Liking What You See, The Lifecycle of Software Objects, What's Expected of us, just excellent themes ideas and reading all around.\n\nThe Selfish Gene (nonfiction) - a classic for understanding evolution and natural selection, especially the realization that the gene is closer to the real unit of selection more than an individual, explaining altruism and colonies and a lot more.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings (fantasy) - I return to LoTR all the time for comfort. I don't think anyone else has created a high fantasy Universe this complex, with so much mythology, symbolism, new languages, mysterious system of magic, ancient and powerful beings and artifacts, beautiful writing and dialog, themes of courage, friendship and heroism, the list goes on and on... You're thrown into a world with characters and references to so many things that are part of this ancient world and never really introduced. There's always more to find on each reading.\n\nThe Martian (~scifi) - top tier science porn, competence porn, fast paced and fun.\n\nThe Vital Question (nonfiction) - First time I intuitively grokked the bridge from geology to biology, the origin of life, and likelihood of life in the Universe at large at various stages of complexity and development. Also all other Nick Lane books.\n\nHow To Live by Derek Sivers (nonfiction) - 27 conflicting answers to how to live life. Emphasizing the diversity of consistent and possible answers to the meaning and goals of life.\n\n1984 (nonfiction) - Classic. Newspeak, Ministry of Truth, Doublethink, Thoughtcrime, Facecrime, Unperson, the list just keeps on going. Chilling world-building and the realization that weaker equivalents of everything exist.\n\nIn Defense of Food by Pollan (nonfiction/food) - Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. The book that first taught me to avoid the entire center of every grocery store and only shop on the outer ring. The realization that the food industry is out of control and the things they do with your food, what they put into it, what they are allowed to do, and how they are allowed to market it to you is quite a lot worse than I thought.\n\nThe Accidental Superpower by Zeihan (nonfiction/geopolitcs) - I've found Zeihan to be a bit of a mixed bag over time but I still remember his books (esp this one) to be elucidating on geopolitics.\n\nCountdown to Zero Day (nonfiction/cyberwarfare) - Goes into detail on Stuxnet, imo very important and highly elucidating reading on cybersecurity, the future of warfare, and AGI.\n\nA Fire Upon the Deep (scifi) - Chapter one only, incredible portrayal of what superintelligence will be like that has stayed with me since.\n\nGuns Germs and Steel (nonfiction/history) - I'd probably recommend a summary of this book more than the book itself. I remember it being very dry, but it was very interesting because it is a comprehensive analysis of the resources grid (food, animals, freshwater, climate, ...) in our real-world game of Civilization, and the implications there of.\n\nFlowers of Algernon (scifi) - Just a totally crushing masterpiece on intelligence.\n\nAtlas Shrugged (scifi) - No one finishes this I think but the first few chapters and its worldbuilding are enough and, once seen in an exaggerated form in fiction, elements of it cannot be fully unseen in reality.\n\nAn Immense World (nonfiction/bio, by Yong, among others of his) - Nice book on so many different sensors used by various animals, you repeatedly realize human senses are super inadequate and that we only measure such a tiny sliver of reality.\n\nThe Master Switch (nonfiction/tech history, by Wu) - history of information technologies telegraph, telephony, radio, television, film, cable television, internet and the pattern of \"The Cycle\", where each medium starts decentralized, open and idealistic and then progresses towards centralization, control and oligopoly, for the very similar reasons, by very similar means, and usually at the expense of diversity, innovation and technological progress. Quite a few connections to draw on for LLMs, which are after all an information technology too.\n\n(I take recommendations for more that are likely to make this list!)","tweeted_at":"2024-12-09T01:01:48.000Z","tweet_url":"https://x.com/karpathy/status/1865924776214327360"},{"profile_image_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1593304942210478080/TUYae5z7_normal.jpg","screen_name":"shadcn","name":"shadcn","full_text":"Sora (.com) is built using shadcn/ui üòé\nhttps://t.co/94tIaLkPHN","tweeted_at":"2024-12-09T19:42:34.000Z","extended_media":[{"display_url":"pic.x.com/94tIaLkPHN","expanded_url":"https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1866194858769260803/video/1","id_str":"1866194566795382785","indices":[39,62],"media_key":"7_1866194566795382785","media_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1866194566795382785/pu/img/1vOL3Mt5qk1YIym-.jpg","source_status_id_str":"1866194858769260803","source_user_id_str":"4398626122","type":"video","url":"https://t.co/94tIaLkPHN","additional_media_info":{"monetizable":false,"source_user":{"user_results":{"result":{"__typename":"User","id":"VXNlcjo0Mzk4NjI2MTIy","rest_id":"4398626122","affiliates_highlighted_label":{},"has_graduated_access":true,"parody_commentary_fan_label":"None","is_blue_verified":true,"profile_image_shape":"Square","legacy":{"following":false,"can_dm":false,"can_media_tag":true,"created_at":"Sun Dec 06 22:51:08 +0000 2015","default_profile":true,"default_profile_image":false,"description":"OpenAI‚Äôs mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.

(frontend, backend, sign in, landing page)\n\nHere's all my findings:\n\n1. Documentation is key! Spend 80% of your time with GPT4o1 model. \n\nYou need to create document for everything. \n- Project Requirements Doc (PRD)\n- Each Page layout and structure\n- App flow doc\n- App functionality doc\n\nOnce you have the docs. Save them in .md format and go to Claude!\n\nYes Claude.\n\n2. Claude will be your main brain. (Claude 3.5 sonnet available on cursor is dumb, I doubt it is 3.5 sonnet)\n\nSo create a PROJECT on Claude and upload all docs you've created with o1 model.\n\n3. Now go to v0 by vercel. (v0 will be your best frontend designer)\n\nStart a new PROJECT on v0.\n\nTake each page doc like (dashboard page, app flow and functionality docs) and paste it there.\n\nNow v0 will have the context about the project, tech stack, flow and what this app will do.\n\nNow start building frontend components. \n\nMake sure you break down each page into multiple components like\n- header\n- metrics\n- form\nEtc\n\nThis will help you refine the code with v0 without breaking.\n\nBecause you have all docs ready, it'll save you alot of time on v0 and v0 components will be designed quickly.\n\n(v0 starts breaking up after v10 of any component, so fork it before v10 and continue the editing)\n\nOnce you have al the components ready from v0.\n\n4. Go back to Claude and paste each page code in Claude Project.\n\nThis will give Claude the context of the code + the requirements of the project. \n\nIt will help you when you work on cursor.\n\n5. Now go to replit. (Replit will help you connect Cursor + Github + Localhost)\n\nGo to Replit, start new Nextjs Repl.\n\n(I personally use Supabase + Nextjs Starter kit boilerplate from Supabase) it's good.\n\nConnect Github\n\nConnect cursor with SSH connection.\n\n6. Now go to cursor. Create all folders and files Claude ask you to create.\n\nRun project on Replit.\n\nPaste the code in specific folders.\n\nInstall all dependencies.\n\nNow you have the frontend code steup.\n\n7. Create backend. I use Supabase to create the database, storage and even auth too.\n\nAI can code you the Database tables, that's the best part.\n\nSo go to Supabase, start new project.\n\nGet your keys and paste in env.local file in cursor.\n\nNow you have connected supabase.\n\n8. Ask AI to help you create backend (database tables, storage buckets, auth tables)\n\nFollow the instructions Claude is giving you.\n\nOnce you're done. Now you'll have a proper Web app with frontend, backend and sign in sign up functionality. \n\n9. This is debugging and refinement time. \n\nTest all features on all pages and use claude + cursor composer to get the debugging work done.\n\n10. Design the landing page.\n\nO1 for content and lauout\nV0 for code.\nCursor for assembling code.\nReplit to deploy your landing page.\n\nNow you have a Modern Web app with Modern Landing page.\n\nIt looks complicated right? But it's not.\n\nIt's never been as easy to hard code software before. \n\n50 days back i didn't know;\n- Next js App router \n- database tables\n- auth functions\n- shadcn Radix\n- SSH connection\n\nAI helped me learn coding. Now I can code a proper web app in max 7 days.\n\nCoded 7 projects in last 30 days.\n\nNow my plan is to, not share the business plans but build businesses with AI code.\n\nAnd sell the projects on Acquire .com or to clients (as I'm doing right now)\n\nAnd repeat.\n\nI love to build, so I'll continue that.\n\nSend me a DM if you need any specific help. \n\nShare the tweet to break me free from Algo bans.\n\nThanks.\n\n-

for the app\n- Implemented Google sign-in for user authentication in the app\n- Requested AI to generate initial app structure and features\n- Added user management functionality to the application interface\n- Created a task creation feature for adding non-negotiable tasks\n- Built a weekly view grid to display tasks for team members\n- Added color-coding for task status (blue, green, red)\n- Implemented hover functionality to display detailed task information\n- Refined UI with improved styling and layout adjustments\n- Deployed the completed application on Replit's hosting service\n-

Not the company, but them as an individual. Imagine owning 1% of rev share of everything that Marc Loe, Pieter Levels or other good makers produce (not for life, e.g. for 5 years).\n\n- VC money (unless u need to buy GPUs) will rather look negative on a startup than positive. YC will still be positive. It's not about the money, but rather a network and a \"medal\".\n\n- Startup incubators will collapse as a business model, except top 1%. Being on X brings 100x more value than any average incubator.\n\n- Holdcos will be the best new way to become rich.\nI see them as little monopolies that aren't illegal (for now).\n\n- Influencers will all ship lots of apps, sites, saas, marketplaces and other digital products (in addition to physical products, courses, events and things they did in the past).\n\n- the bar to build and ship tech product is so low, one need no coding skills at all with tools like V0, Bolt, Replit, Cursor. At first we will see simple products being shipped this way, but it complexity will grow as the models improve.\n\n- whitelabel model will have it's new renaissance. I bet on it myself. Have more than 10 partners working with me now to launch whitelabeled version of my tools to other markets or niches. \n\nLet's revisit this prediction in 20

I feel very uncomfortable letting AI take control of my code, but for the sake of science, I spent two hours building an application that took me weeks to build a couple of years ago.\n‚Äã\nI used Pythagora, a brand new tool backed by Y Combinator. They just released to the public.\n‚Äã\nKeep in mind that I use AI every day to write code, but Pythagora is something different: it's a tool that leads, and uses you‚Äîthe human‚Äîas the copilot.\n‚Äã\nI go into more details in the video, but here is the TLDR;\n‚Äã\n1. Holy molly! We've made a ton of progress on this front! This is way better than Devin when I tested it a few months back.\n‚Äã\n2. Love the approach of generating a plan with sub-tasks before writing any code.\n‚Äã\n3. The tools never tries to do too much: it tackles every small task one at a time, and gives you instructions so you test everything.\n‚Äã\n4. It does exactly what you'd do when it gets stuck: writes a bunch of logs and uses those to correct itself. Pretty neat!\n‚Äã\n5. It's fast. It runs locally. It's an extension to Visual Studio Code.\n‚Äã\nI'm impressed, but I don't think this tool is for me.\n‚Äã\nI'm not the type of developer who's ready to relinquish control. I felt I had no connection with the code because I didn't write it. It was not my code.\n‚Äã\nI know many people who don't care about this. I know many people who will get tremendous value out of Pythagora. I hope they keep pushing the limits, providing feedback, and helping this get to a point where old folks like me feel more comfortable using it.\n‚Äã\nDon't take my word for it. The best thing you can do is to give it a try and see how you feel using it.\n‚Äã\nThanks to the team who built this, for all of the explanations and support, and especially, for sitting and listening to my dumb questions for 2 hours while I tested this.","tweeted_at":"2024-10-01T13:06:36.000Z","extended_media":[{"display_url":"pic.x.com/4EQH0Hb85t","expanded_url":"https://x.com/svpino/status/1841102417003171964/video/1","id_str":"1841101423137701898","indices":[275,298],"media_key":"7_1841101423137701898","media_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1841101423137701898/pu/img/diW7DN63L27u8-ph.jpg","type":"video","url":"https://t.co/4EQH0Hb85t","additional_media_info":{"monetizable":false},"ext_media_availability":{"status":"Available"},"sizes":{"large":{"h":720,"w":1280,"resize":"fit"},"medium":{"h":675,"w":1200,"resize":"fit"},"small":{"h":383,"w":680,"resize":"fit"},"thumb":{"h":150,"w":150,"resize":"crop"}},"original_info":{"height":720,"width":1280,"focus_rects":[]},"allow_download_status":{"allow_download":true},"video_info":{"aspect_ratio":[16,9],"duration_millis":517475,"variants":[{"content_type":"application/x-mpegURL","url":"https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1841101423137701898/pu/pl/V6e-M22AyAwLmXXO.m3u8?tag=12&v=e0e"},{"bitrate":256000,"content_type":"video/mp4","url":"https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1841101423137701898/pu/vid/avc1/480x270/yfof8LjhS46CSOKu.mp4?tag=12"},{"bitrate":832000,"content_type":"video/mp4","url":"https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1841101423137701898/pu/vid/avc1/640x360/KUC1nmI3fHtAfJe7.mp4?tag=12"},{"bitrate":2176000,"content_type":"video/mp4","url":"https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1841101423137701898/pu/vid/avc1/1280x720/d9JMZtYNjC3rlsOi.mp4?tag=12"}]},"media_results":{"result":{"media_key":"7_1841101423137701898"}}}],"tweet_url":"https://x.com/svpino/status/1841102417003171964"},{"profile_image_url_https":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1699998102172901376/lAQDcia9_normal.jpg","screen_name":"codiku_dev","name":"Codiku","full_text":"Hey  guys, @ollama is sooo awesome.\n\nI am building a FULLY LOCAL ai assitant DESKTOP app that can pop anywhere.\nIt can access web and learn.
