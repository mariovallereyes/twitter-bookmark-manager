Introduction
The Twitter Bookmark Manager project aims to create a robust system for managing, categorizing, and searching through Twitter bookmarks efficiently. The system is structured into modular components to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance. At its core, it employs Python with key libraries such as Tweepy for data ingestion, Flask for web-based interaction, and a local inference model (Mistral-7B) for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Data ingestion is streamlined via the Twitter Bookmarks v2 API with a focus on error handling and efficient pagination, while media files are organized by user ID for seamless retrieval and reduced collisions. Zero-shot classification using Hugging Face's bart-large-mnli enables automated categorization into predefined groups (e.g., Articles, Tutorials, News), with embeddings stored in ChromaDB for rapid access. Deduplication logic ensures a clean dataset by leveraging text embeddings for similarity scoring and image hashing for media redundancy checks. Secure SQLite database connections manage bookmark data, categories, and associated media while preserving sensitive credentials through encrypted secrets management.
The RAG-based system elevates the app by allowing users to search and interact with their bookmarks in a conversational manner. The retriever identifies the top 5 relevant bookmarks based on query embeddings, while Mistral-7B generates context-aware responses guided by user-specific bookmark metadata. Accessibility and cross-platform compatibility are prioritized, with WAI-ARIA labels and Windows-specific adaptations (e.g., os.path.join for paths) integrated. A Flask-powered UI offers a sleek and functional front-end with features such as advanced search filters, a chat interface for interactive responses, and soft-delete capabilities for bookmarks. Supporting scripts, such as media cleanup and database backup utilities, ensure long-term maintainability, while rigorous unit tests validate every aspect of the system. The project’s design combines cutting-edge AI, a secure architecture, and an intuitive user experience, making it a comprehensive solution for managing Twitter bookmarks efficiently.

Implementation Notes:
•	core/: All logic-based modules. Keep them small, modular, and unit-tested.
•	web/: UI layer and Flask app—handle minimal business logic here and delegate to core/.
•	database/: Adapters for data persistence. Splitting connectors (db.py) from table definitions (models.py) keeps responsibilities clear.
•	models/: Large local inference model(s). They can be placed here or in a custom path. Ensure .gitignore is configured to avoid committing large model files.
•	media/: Organized by user_id to prevent collisions. Use subfolders if needed (images, video, etc.).
•	config/: Sensitive credentials (secrets.json) should never be committed in plaintext.
•	tests/: Use pytest for thorough coverage (both unit and integration tests).
•	requirements.txt: Pin versions to avoid dependency breakage. Example: tweepy==4.14.0.
•	main.py: High-level script to initialize the entire service (load environment variables, set up DB, run Flask).

2. Key Technology Updates
1.	RAG Model
o	Switched to Mistral-7B-Instruct (Q4 quantized) from TheBloke’s repository.
o	This model offers high accuracy for generative responses in a retrieval-augmented pipeline while keeping memory usage relatively low.
2.	Accessibility
o	The web UI includes WAI-ARIA labels, alt tags for media, and a toggle for high-contrast mode.
o	Provide keyboard navigability for all interactive elements (buttons, input fields).
3.	Windows Compatibility
o	All file/directory paths must use os.path.join(...).
o	Test on Windows 10/11 with Python 3.10 or later.
o	Dependencies are verified to have Windows-compatible wheels.
4.	Manual Deletion
o	Bookmarks are deleted via UI with a soft-delete approach:
	The bookmarks row is moved to deleted_bookmarks (or a deleted_at timestamp is set).
	A DB trigger or a background task removes associated media and embeddings from ChromaDB.

3. Detailed Component Specifications
3.1 Data Ingestion (Prompt for Cursor)
Suggested Prompt

"Create a Python script using Tweepy that paginates through Twitter bookmarks v2 API. Include error handling for rate limits and media download retries. Store raw data in SQLite with tables: bookmarks (id, text, author, timestamp), media (id, bookmark_id, path, hash), categories (id, name)."

Implementation Details:
•	Pagination: Use Tweepy’s Paginator to step through bookmarks.
•	Rate Limit Handling: Use exponential backoff on HTTP 429.
•	Media Download:
1.	Validate content-type (images vs. videos).
2.	Retry downloads up to 3 times if connection errors occur.
3.	Store files in ./media/{user_id}/{media_id}.{ext}.
•	Database Storage:
o	bookmarks(id, text, author, timestamp).
o	media(id, bookmark_id, path, hash).
o	categories(id, name) → Pre-seeded with your main categories.
o	Use placeholders and parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection.
•	Logging: Implement standard Python logging for ingestion events (e.g., successful pagination, error messages).
________________________________________
3.2 AI Categorization (Prompt for Cursor)
Suggested Prompt

"Implement zero-shot classification with Hugging Face's 'facebook/bart-large-mnli'. For each tweet text, assign a category from ['Articles', 'Tutorials', 'News', 'Memes', 'Inspiration']. Save results to SQLite and generate embeddings with 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'."

Implementation Details:
•	Zero-Shot Classifier:
o	Load bart-large-mnli with transformers.pipeline("zero-shot-classification", ...).
o	Provided candidate labels: ['Articles', 'Tutorials', 'News', 'Memes', 'Inspiration'].
o	Whichever category has the highest confidence is assigned.
•	Embedding Generation:
o	Use sentence-transformers (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to create a 384-dim embedding.
o	Store these embeddings in ChromaDB for retrieval in the RAG pipeline.
•	Performance:
o	Batch classification calls if you have many bookmarks.
o	Consider caching results to avoid repeated classification on unchanged tweets.
________________________________________
3.3 Deduplication Logic
•	Text:
o	Compute embedding similarity. If cosine similarity < 0.1, flag as duplicate.
o	You can use more advanced thresholds or also check exact string matches.
•	Images:
o	Use dhash from imagehash library to generate a 64-bit hash.
o	If the Hamming distance is below a certain threshold (e.g., 5 bits), consider it a duplicate.
•	Deduplication Action:
o	Merge duplicates into a single row, preserving combined metadata (e.g., union of categories).
o	If multiple same images link to different bookmarks, link them to one “canonical” entry.

3.4 RAG System (Prompt for Cursor)
Suggested Prompt

"Configure a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system with Llama-cpp-python. Use Mistral-7B for response generation. Implement a retriever that searches ChromaDB for top 5 relevant bookmarks based on user query embeddings. Add a prompt template to guide the model to reference only the user's bookmarks."

Implementation Details:
1.	Embeddings Store:
o	ChromaDB storing embeddings from all-MiniLM-L6-v2.
o	Index is keyed by bookmark_id.
2.	Retriever:
o	For a user query, generate an embedding using the same model (MiniLM).
o	Query ChromaDB for the top 5 hits, retrieving the original text + metadata.
3.	Prompt Template (for Mistral-7B Instruct):
o	Example:
sql
Copy
You are a helpful assistant. You have access to the user’s bookmarked tweets.
Given the user’s question, reference ONLY the user’s bookmarks. 
<CONTEXT>
  {matched_bookmarks}
</CONTEXT>
Question: {user_query}
Answer:
o	This ensures Mistral-7B includes the relevant tweets in its generative response.
4.	Inference Parameters:
o	n_ctx = 2048 or lower to match available RAM.
o	temperature = 0.7 (tunable).
o	max_tokens depends on your use case, typically 256–512 for Q&A.

3.5 Web UI Features
•	Flask Endpoints:
1.	/search?q=...:
	Returns JSON (or SSE) with relevant bookmarks.
	Use query param for text searching, or add advanced filters (category, date range).
2.	/delete/<bookmark_id>:
	Locates the bookmark in the database.
	Soft-deletes by marking or moving to a deleted_bookmarks table.
	A background script or DB trigger handles cleanup of media & embeddings.
3.	/chat:
	SSE (Server-Sent Events) streaming endpoint.
	Accepts a user query, passes it to the RAG pipeline, streams model output chunk by chunk.
•	Accessibility:
o	All images have alt="Tweet media from @{author}".
o	Buttons or interactive elements include aria-label="Delete bookmark".
o	Provide a high-contrast CSS toggle (e.g., a button that toggles a body.high-contrast class).
o	Ensure keyboard focus states are visible with CSS.

4. Setup Instructions for Windows
4.1 Prerequisites
1.	Python 3.10
o	During installation, check "Add Python to PATH".
2.	C++ Build Tools
o	Required by llama-cpp-python to compile the native bindings.
o	Install with Chocolatey:

choco install visualstudio2022buildtools --params "--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools"
3.	Virtual Environment
o	(Recommended) python -m venv venv and .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows.
4.	Install Dependencies
o	Once the venv is activated,
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
4.2 Cursor Prompts for Initial Setup
Prompt #1

"Initialize a Python project with a virtual environment. Install packages:  
- flask tweepy sentence-transformers chromadb sqlalchemy transformers imagehash llama-cpp-python python-dotenv"
Prompt #2

"Create a secrets.json file with placeholders for Twitter API credentials. Encrypt it using AES-256 via the cryptography library. Example structure:  
{
  'client_id': '...',
  'client_secret': '...',
  'redirect_uri': 'http://localhost:5000/callback'
}"
Tip: For encryption, use cryptography.fernet. Generate a key from a user-supplied password and store it as an environment variable. This ensures secrets remain safe if secrets.json accidentally leaks.
4.3 Download Mistral-7B Model
Prompt

"Download the Mistral-7B-Instruct GGUF model from TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF (4-bit quantized) and save to ./models/."
•	Make sure the final file name is consistent (mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf or whichever variant you choose).
•	Store or mount the model outside of version control. Large files can cause slow checkouts.
________________________________________
5. Security & Windows-Specific Notes
1.	Secrets Management
o	Use cryptography.fernet with AES-256.
o	The encryption key is derived from a user-provided password or a system environment variable.
o	Decrypt only at runtime; never store the plaintext keys in the repository.
2.	File Paths
o	Always use os.path.join (e.g., os.path.join('media', user_id, 'image.jpg')) for correct Windows path handling.
o	When storing paths in the DB, consider normalizing them to forward-slash format for cross-platform usage, if needed.
3.	Local LLM
o	Mistral-7B (4-bit quantized) can run on CPU with ~8GB RAM, but performance may be slow.
o	Consider setting a lower context window (n_ctx=1024) or using GPU acceleration if available.
________________________________________
6. Example Workflow
1.	User Authentication via Twitter OAuth
o	The user logs in, obtains an OAuth token for bookmarks access.
2.	Bookmark Fetch
o	The system calls data_ingestion.py to page through the Twitter Bookmarks v2 API.
o	Bookmarks and media are stored in SQLite.
o	Deduplication may run on-the-fly or after ingestion completes.
3.	AI Categorization
o	For each new tweet, run zero-shot classification → store category.
o	Generate embeddings and store them in ChromaDB for fast search.
4.	RAG Search/Chat
o	When the user searches, or opens the chat interface, the query is embedded and top bookmarks are retrieved.
o	Mistral-7B is prompted with the relevant bookmark contexts.
o	A final response is generated referencing the user’s bookmark data.
5.	User Deletion
o	The user may press a “Delete” button to remove a bookmark, triggering a cascade that either moves the record to deleted_bookmarks or sets a deleted_at value.
o	A background script or cron job handles physically deleting old records and associated media.
________________________________________
7. Testing Prompts for Cursor
1.	Deduplication Module

"Write a pytest for the deduplication module: simulate 10 bookmarks with 2 duplicates, check if they’re merged."
o	Tests both text-based and image-based duplication.
o	Verifies that the final DB state has the correct number of unique records.
2.	Flask Search Endpoint

"Create a Flask test client that verifies the /search endpoint returns correct results for a mock bookmark database."
o	Mock or seed the database with known bookmarks.
o	Use client.get('/search?q=keyword') and check JSON results.
Additional Recommendation: Use coverage reports (coverage.py) to ensure all critical paths (pagination, classification, RAG) are tested.
________________________________________
8. Support Scripts
1.	media_cleanup.py
o	Schedule (e.g., Windows Task Scheduler) to remove orphaned media files that no longer have a corresponding bookmark.
o	Cross-check the media table or deleted_bookmarks.
2.	backup_db.py
o	Compress SQLite and ChromaDB directories into a ZIP.
o	May run nightly or weekly.
o	Keep versioned backups to quickly restore if corruption occurs.
